# Websocket

## Launch

from the project's root directory type the following commands:
1. `npm install` (restify and socket.io)
2. `gulp deploy` (chat.html)
3. `node ./server/server.js`  

then in your favorite browser open several tabs to this location :  
[http://localhost:8080/chat.html](http://localhost:8080/chat.html)

## Then what?

- Chat with yourself (I'm Pretty sure that this isn't an efficient therapyâ€¦ but who knows ?).
- Find a way to test all that.
