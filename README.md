This is the client-side repository of the `Battleship 2` game.
The server (NodeJS) repository is hosted at [https://github.com/battleship2/battleship2.0-server](https://github.com/battleship2/battleship2.0-server).

## Dependencies
The client relies on several well-known libraries such as:
- [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- ...

**Important note about Gulp:**
_The project is configured to use Gulp v4 and above.
Please refer to this [link](https://demisx.github.io/gulp4/2015/01/15/install-gulp4.html) to check how to configure it in your environment._

## Launch
From the project's root directory, type the following commands:

1. `npm install` -> Install the required NPM dependencies
2. `gulp` or `npm start` -> Start the project

## Tests, Bugs & Contributions
While we do our best to get the whole project tested, do not hesitate to PR us if you ever find a bug. 
To launch all the tests, type the following command:

`npm test`

## Working with the sources

The project offers a few helpers to make the running up faster.
Refer to this guide to know how and when to use them.

#### Cleaning up

* `gulp clean`:
Clear the temporary files and set the project into a clean state.

#### Bundling

* `gulp build`:
Build and prepare the files into the `dist` directory with development target.
**N.B: This does not compile the project for release purposes. See `gulp build:prod` for that.**

* `gulp build:staging`:
Build and prepare the files into the `dist` directory with staging target.
This step imitates the production bundle with all the development assets (console logging, debugging, tools, etc.)
**N.B: This does not compile the project for release purposes. See `gulp build:prod` for that.**

* `gulp build:prod`:
Build and prepare the files into the `dist` directory with production target.
Will produce a minified, optimized bundle for fast delivery into browsers.

Please note that each of the above environments is configured through a property file (see `./src/environments/environment[.TARGET].ts`).
