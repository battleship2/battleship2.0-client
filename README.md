# Battleship 2 | Client repository
This is the client-side repository of the `Battleship 2` game.
The server (NodeJS) repository is hosted at [https://github.com/battleship2/battleship2.0-server](https://github.com/battleship2/battleship2.0-server).

## Dependencies
The client relies on several well-known libraries such as:
- [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- ...

**Important note about Gulp:**
_The project is configured to use Gulp v4 and above.
Please refer to this [link](https://demisx.github.io/gulp4/2015/01/15/install-gulp4.html) to check how to configure it in your environment._

## Launch
From the project's root directory, type the following commands:

1. `npm install` -> Install the required NPM dependencies
1. `bower install` -> Install the required Bower dependencies
2. `gulp` or `npm start` -> Start the project

## Tests, Bugs & Contributions

## Working with the sources

The project offers a few helpers to make the running up faster.
Refer to this guide to know how and when to use them.

Clear the temporary files and set the project into a clean state.

#### Development

* `gulp ts`:

Starts the livereload server and opens the browser.

* `gulp bower`:
Binds the bower dependencies directly where they belong in the `index.html` file.
